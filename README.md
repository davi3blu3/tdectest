## The Challenge
We're asking the applicants to perform a basic HTML/CSS competency test. Attached is a zip file that contains the materials needed. 

## Instructions
Use "page-example.jpg" as a mock-up example to create a single working web page using hand-coded HTML and CSS.

 * The code should be written by the applicant without the use of libraries (bootstrap, materialize, etc.) or layout programs (Adobe Muse or Webflow, etc.) 
 * The use of a css reset is permitted. 
 * The two image files needed for the graphics on the page have been provided in the zip as well. 
 * The content is mostly "lorem ipsum" and they can get a copy of that from lorem2.com, we're not looking for an exact match with what the content says, but will consider how closely styled it is. 
 * Sizing on elements such as font size, margin and padding, image sizes, etc should be consistent with the mock up, but do not have to match exactly. 
 * Responsive code based on viewport width is not required but encouraged. 

Once the applicant has completed the task, they should zip up their working directory and return it for our review.
