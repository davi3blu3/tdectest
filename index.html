            <p>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Red Five standing by. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possiblyâ€¦ The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</em></p>
            <p>Ye-ha! But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</p>
            <p>But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.</p>
            <p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. I'm trying not to, kid. You don't believe in the Force, do you? You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</p>
            <p>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.</p>
            <p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. You mean it controls your actions?</p>
            <p>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. He is here. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.</p>
            <p>As you wish. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I call it luck. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? You think a princess and I guy like me -- NO.</p>
